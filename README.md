I'm a Ph.D. student by day and a software engineer by the cover of night.
My research focuses on Statistical Relational Learning (STARAI) and its
applications to Health Informatics problems. I want to build trust in artificial
intelligence by making results open, reproducible, and accessible to others.

### What am I up to? 🤔

- 🤰 Performing secondary analysis for the progression of [gestational diabetes in nulliparous women](https://doc.numom2b.org/en/latest/)
- 🔧 Building tools to make STARAI more accessible
- ✍️ Writing longer discussions on [my blog](https://hayesall.com/blog/)
- 📫 Responding to emails: hayesall@iu.edu
- 📚 Reading on Bayesian Networks, see my notes at: http://bayes.hayesall.com
- 🖥️ Implementing in Python/Bash/Java, pulling Julia and Rust into my workflows
