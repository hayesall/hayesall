I'm a Ph.D. student by day and a software engineer by the cover of night.
My research focuses on Statistical Relational Learning (STARAI) and its
applications to Health Informatics problems.

- 🔧 Building tools to make STARAI more accessible. See my progress in the [srlearn organization](https://github.com/srlearn/)
- ✍️ Writing longer discussions on [my blog](https://hayesall.com/blog/)
- 👁️ Learning about computer vision
